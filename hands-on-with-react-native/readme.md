# Hands-on with React.Native

We're going to use the standard helpers that come with React.Native to create new apps.

`npm install -g create-react-native-app`

Create a new app.

`create-react-native-app nottsjs`

Next you'll need to start your Android Virtual Device.

`android avd`

And finally you can run the app.

`npm start android`
