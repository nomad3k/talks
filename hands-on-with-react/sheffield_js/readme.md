# Sheffield JS

This is the live coding file that was created during the Sheffield JS demo.

To use this file you will need to do the following:

Install Yeoman

`npm install -g yeoman`

Install the React Webpack yeoman generator.

`npm install generator-react-webpack`

Copy `app.jsx` into `src/components` and edit the following line in `/src/index.js`.

`import App from './components/Main';` becomes `import App from './components/app';`

Then run...

`npm start`
